# Potential-due-to-non-uniform-charge-distribution-on-a-Disk-using-Python
This repository demonstrates numerical integration techniques applied to physics problems, specifically calculating the electric potential due to a non-uniform charge distribution on a disk. It includes implementations of the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's 1/3 rule using both custom algorithms and NumPy integration tools.
